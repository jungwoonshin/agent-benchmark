# Cursor Rules for Agent System

## Core Principles

### 1. General Agent Problem Solving Capability
- **Maintain GAIA Dataset Compatibility**: All code modifications must preserve the system's ability to solve general agent-related problems, particularly those found in the GAIA dataset benchmark
- **Task Decomposition**: Ensure the hierarchical task decomposition system remains functional for complex multi-step problems
- **Tool Integration**: Maintain the flexible tool integration patterns (chaining, fallback, parallel execution) that enable solving diverse problem types
- **When modifying existing code**: Verify that changes don't break compatibility with GAIA-style problems requiring web browsing, file processing, calculations, and multi-tool orchestration

### 2. Dependency Management with UV
- **Use `uv` for all dependency operations**: Install, update, and manage dependencies using `uv` instead of `pip`
- **Commands to use**:
  - `uv pip install <package>` instead of `pip install <package>`
  - `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` for installing from requirements
  - `uv run <command>` to run Python scripts with managed environment
  - `uv pip compile requirements.txt` to generate lock files
- **When adding dependencies**: Add them to `requirements.txt` and use `uv` to install
- **Environment management**: Prefer `uv`'s virtual environment management over manual venv creation

### 3. Code Standards
- **Do not create markdown files**: Never create `.md` documentation files unless explicitly requested
- **Use structured code and objects**: Prefer well-organized classes, objects, and structured data over unstructured code or flat implementations
